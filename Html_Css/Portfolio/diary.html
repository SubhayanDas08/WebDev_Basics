            Well mid sems came and the usual process of midnight studies started and to be honest it is an adventure in hostel, friends kicking your hostel room door at 3am to find whether I have coffee or not because they are falling asleep.

            Midsems ended, I had a blast with my friends which was totally non alcholic. Then I had an accident in gym which led to my pelvic muscles rupture. I came back home before holi for treatment. I was planning to go back in a week as we had a plan to go on
            a roadtrip to Puri but as everyone knows the national lockdown occured which ruined all my plans.
