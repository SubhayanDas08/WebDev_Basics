><p style="text-align:center;"><br>COVID-19 has turned into a global crisis,
evolving at unprecedented speed and
scale. It is creating a universal imperative
for governments and organizations to take
immediate action to protect their people.
It is now the biggest global event—and
challenge—of our lifetimes. As such, it is
changing human attitudes and behaviors
today and forcing organizations to
respond. However, the need to respond
won’t end when the virus’s immediate
threat eventually recedes.

My experience
</h1><h3>Imagine it's September 2021. Things are back
to normal. We can meet face to face.
Travel is possible. But things have changed. COVID-19
has forever changed the experience of
being a customer, an employee, a citizen
and a human. Expect to see behavior
change at scale for some time to come</h3>
<p> <font color="red;">What will have changed in the way we think? How will that affect
the way we design, communicate, build and run the experiences
that people need and want? The answers to these questions will lie
in the way people react and how individuals, families and social
groups—all sources of creative innovation—hack new ways to live.
Every organization must become a listener—sharpening their
sensitivity to signals in real time in order to respond immediately.
We are witnessing massive behavior change at a scale and speed
that we’ve never seen before, sparked by fear, proselytized by
social media, encouraged by government. Such change includes
frequent handwashing, working from home and discouraging bad
behavior such as toilet paper hoarding.

</p>
<p>
This goes way beyond “nudge” techniques, though some are
being used, and extends to outright insistence that is either
working naturally or enforced. Twitter even launched a
handwashing emoji.1
The science of behavior change had already become a known
subject of study and an increasingly important tool for design
over the past ten years. Leading companies had already
instituted tools and practices to monitor, collect, analyze and
act on a mix of digital surveys, behavioral signals, listening
and sentiment.
Now, the need for these capabilities will become foundational
to experience creation, and the speed at which companies
can—and, increasingly must—respond to them will become
sources of competitive advantage.
The formula is listen, pivot, learn, reassess

<h2>
The time to act is now. This
document outlines the practical
steps you should take to get started.

</h2>
<h1>Five major human
implications to expect from
people’s behavior now, and next </h1>

<h2>
 1.The cost of
confidence
</h2>
The erosion of confidence will
make trust way more
important than ever before.
This will necessitate a “trust
multiplier”—action that, to be
effective, rebuilds trust
quickly and credibly. Focus
will be on confidence-building
through every channel.
Justifiable optimism will sell
well. All of this may change
the nature of what we regard
as premium products
and services.
<h1> 2. The virtual
century</h1>
The enforced shift during
the worst of the pandemic to
virtual working, consuming
and socializing will fuel a
massive and further shift to
virtual activity for anything.
Anything that can be done
virtually will be. Winners will
be those who test and
explore all of the associated
creative possibilities.
<h1>
3.Every business
is a health
business
</h1>
The concerns about health
amplified during the crisis will
not ebb after it is over. Rather,
health will dominate. A health
economy will emerge with
opportunities for all to plug
into. Every business will need
to understand how it can be
part of a new health
ecosystem that will dominate
citizen thinking.
<h1>4. Cocooning</h1>
Desire for cocooning, along
with opportunities for those
with creative strategies to
enable it, will move centerstage
for the same reason.
Winners will be those who
zero their sights on the home.
At the height of the crisis,
many—workers, especially—
are spending more time at
home. After, this pattern will
endure with meaningfulness
and comfort carrying
a price premium.
<h1>5. The reinvention
of authority </h1>
A reinvention of authority is
likely after the effect of travel
limitations, self-isolation and
lockdown officially mandated
by many governments. This is
likely to be the trickiest of the
five human implications as its
impact could go one of two
ways. If governments get their
handling of the crisis broadly
right, expect top-down
control to be back in fashion;
if not, the reverse. This is likely
to vary by geography. What
role will companies play?
<h1 style="text-align:center;" >
Impact
</h1>
<h4>People are postponing purchase decisions</h4> in many categories due to uncertainty.
This will continue after the immediate threat dissipates. In China, sales of gold and
silver, for example, crashed by 41.1 percent in January and February 2020, year on
year.2 A wait-and-see mentality will reign. It will affect many sectors.
<h4>Noise is a problem</h4>. There is a lot of information about COVID-19, and speculation —
everyone has something to say, but should they say it? A mail from a hotel you stayed
at ten years ago telling you how they are handling the situation is less than helpful.
Those only virtue signalling in their brand communications about COVID-19 will pay a
price.3 Some airlines during the crisis, for example, were still offering May/June flight
deals without referencing uncertainty. In the face of difficult memes, Corona Beer’s
silence has been a model of good behavior.
<h4>The familiar will be more valuable</h4>. Established brands that handle the crisis well will
rise in stature and value. Risk will be less tolerable to most people. New social circles
may arise based on attitudes to risk—for example, some people may prefer to
socialize with others who share the same cautious or intrepid attitudes. Brands need
to take note of these affiliations and decide where they stand. Insurance—both with a
small and big ‘i’ – will be very important, but only when it is trusted to really deliver.
<h4>Individualism may rise </h4>with more people adopting a look-after-yourself-first policy.
Trust in people you cannot see on a daily basis should not be assumed, and those
wanting to build trust in this context will have to work harder to do so. Conversely the
community response to the pandemic will be remembered as a critical way of
flattening its rise, and aspects of it will be associated with shared joy—notably, Italy’s
daily ritual of balcony music during its national lockdown
<p>
<h3>How to respond</h3>
Brands will need to focus on reassurance and confidence-building. Companies must consider “Cost of Confidence” —
the investment needed to provide customers with reassurance. Within this context, factors will vary by product or
service but might include cleanliness, timeliness or ethical sourcing.
<h6>NOW</h6>
• Run an end-to-end Customer Experience Audit:
Create a remedial plan based on your audit findings.<br>
• Roadmap the need for your products and services, now and
next: Use Personas and Journeys to define how this plays out
during the shutdown and immediately after. <br>Determine where
reassurance will be needed that a service is reliable and safe.<br>
Establish how you will stay in contact with customers who may
become more irregular for the time being.<br> Explore where
demand might surge.<br>
• Remodel marketing with multi-disciplinary <br>SWAT teams:
Rethink marketing strategy, sales channels and spend based on
new assumptions.<br> Resize budgets and optimize your marketing
op model.<br>
<br>
• Identify new opportunities as normal life resumes:
Explore and define how you can expand your core products,
services and experiences to fit with the new normal.<br>
• Accelerate your experience reaction time:
Address how you take a nimble approach for unforeseen
events like this. Move to a Living Business model.<br>
• Assess the new Cost of Confidence for your
product/service: Price will be very sensitive to trust.<br>
• Appreciate how the nature of premium will change:
Understand where you should be on the new spectrum.
